Individual's decision-making is strongly affected by non-verbal behaviour. The gestures, posture, facial expressions can now be well detected using Artificial Intteligence. Also, many important characteristics may reveal during interactions such as thought process. In order to understand the overall context of the conversation, one must need to analyse and process the situational tenses being involved. </p>\n<!-- <div  style=\"text-align:center;\">Fig 1.</div><br/> -->\n<p><strong>Inspiration of using LSTM Model</strong> - For considering the past references to under the context of the conversation, <strong>memory</strong> is needed. In order to do so, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) can be used where the output from the previous step are fed as input to the current step. But there are few drawbacks of using RNN model.<br/> <br/></p>\n<li> RNNs are not able to keep track of long-term dependencies.\n<li> It is very unstable.\n<li> RNNs cannot be stacked into very deep models.\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 768px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 68.22916666666666%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"LSTM Unit Architecture\"\n        title=\"LSTM Unit Architecture\"\n        src=\"/static/e56f8251d76949120e76fe6f53475d3c/e5715/lstm-architecture.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e56f8251d76949120e76fe6f53475d3c/8514f/lstm-architecture.png 192w,\n/static/e56f8251d76949120e76fe6f53475d3c/804b2/lstm-architecture.png 384w,\n/static/e56f8251d76949120e76fe6f53475d3c/e5715/lstm-architecture.png 768w,\n/static/e56f8251d76949120e76fe6f53475d3c/a0b80/lstm-architecture.png 955w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n    </span></p>\n<p><strong>Long Short Term Memory Model (LSTM)</strong></p>\n<p>A LSTM layer comprises of recurrently connected memory blocks.

Each cell memorizes the previous state’s values over time intervals such that information inside and outside the cell is regulated via these three gates.</p>\n<p>This project is selected for presentation in <strong>SPCOM 2020 conference(International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication)</strong>. <a href=\"https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~spcom/2020/CameraReadySubmissions/263/CameraReadySubmission/Classification_of_social_signals_263_Joshi_Verma_Mishra.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Classification of Social Signals using LSTM","date":"Dec 11, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project/social-signal-LSTM/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/project/humanbody-detection/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Human-Body Skeleton Detection using OpenCV"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/project/github-card/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GitHub Card"}}}}}
