Few of them are listed below:</p>\n<li> <b>Game Strategy</b> - It can be used to understand the gameplay of a player and his next moves to improve the game strategy.\n<li> <b>Orthopaedic patient diagnosis</b> - It can be used by the doctors to understand the key points while analysing the body postures of the patients.\n<li> <b>Injury Analysis of Sportsperson</b> - It can be used by the sports authorities to live track the player's movements and detect the key-points of the body to understand the injury reasons if occured any.\n<li><b>Gymnasium</b> - It can be used by the gymnastic person to improve their movement's in order to prevent future injuries.\n<li><b>Surveillance Activities</b> - Action and behaviour analysis by gestures, body movements, and detection of abnormal activities. \n<p><br/><br/>\nThis project was selected for <b>Industrial Academic Meet (IAM) 2019</b> held at IIIT Raipur under the track - Data Science and Machine Learning.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Human-Body Skeleton Detection using OpenCV","date":"Apr 14, 2019"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project/humanbody-detection/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/project/t&p/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Training and Placement Cell Website"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/project/social-signal-LSTM/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Classification of Social Signals using LSTM"}}}}}
