While a student at DPS and IIIT, I studied Mathematics and I believe that my understanding of problem solving and complex algorithms are also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a developer. Apart from being a technical buff, I am a classical Bharatnatyam dancer, painter, try to pour out my thoughts through my writings and currently, trying my hands on guitar.
