subtitle: 'I am Ananya Verma'
content: 'I am a recent Computer Science Undergrad from IIIT Raipur with array of knowledge in frontend and backend languages, competitive programming and machine learning. While a student at DPS and IIIT, I studied Mathematics and I believe that my understanding of problem solving and complex algorithms are also skills that have and will continue to contribute to my overall success as a developer. Apart from being a technical buff, I am a classical Bharatnatyam dancer, painter, try to pour out my thoughts through my writings and currently, trying my hands on guitar.
The keywords which I believe in are passion, thoughtprocess and smart-hard work.'
